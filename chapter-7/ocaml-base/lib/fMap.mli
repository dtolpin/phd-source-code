(** Finite maps.

    The [FMap] module provides a purely functional finite map datastructure
    based on balanced binary trees.  Most operations on single elements, for
    example adding bindings or testing membership, can be performed in time
    logarithmic in the size of the map.

    This module provides a superset of the operations in the [Map] module in
    the OCaml standard library, but with a polymorphic interface in addition
    to the standard functorial interface.  

    A map provided by this module requires a strict order on its domain
    elements.  When using the polymorphic interface, domain elements are
    compared using the structural comparison operators [(=)] and [(<)].  For
    this reason, the polymorphic interface can only be used if semantic
    equality in the domain type is equivalent to structural equality. *)

type ('a, +'b) t
(** The type of finite maps with domain type ['a] and range type ['b].  Values
    of this type can be considered as finite sets of pairs where an element
    [(x, y)] represents the mapping of [x] to [y].  The domain of a map [m] is
    the set of values [x] such that [m] contains a pair [(x, y)] for some [y]
    ([m] maps [x] to some value); the range of [m] is the set of values [y]
    such that [m] contains a pair [(x, y)] for some [x] (some value is mapped
    to [y] by [m]). *)
