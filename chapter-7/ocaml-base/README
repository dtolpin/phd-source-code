ocaml-base - a standard library extension for OCaml
===================================================

This library is an extension of the OCaml standard library. It provides
extended Array, Char, List, and String modules, data structures for finite
sets and finite maps (based on binary trees of bounded balance as invented 
by Nievergelt and Reingold), dynamic arrays, priority queues (based on
array-embedded heaps), and some utilities.  

Another component of the library is a rather complete and efficient monadic
parser combinator library similar to the Parsec library for Haskell by Daan
Leijen and the FParsec library for F# by Stephan Tolksdorf.


Requirements
------------

ocaml-base depends on the following tools and libraries:

- Regular expression support in ocaml-base relies on the PCRE-OCaml library
  [2].  PCRE is currently used only by the CharStream and MParser modules, but
  the library cannot be loaded without it.

- Compilation is done using the included OCamlMakefile, which requires GNU
  Make.

- Installation uses the Findlib library manager [3].

ocaml-base has been tested with OCaml 3.10, but should also work with older
versions.


Installation
------------

Unpack in any directory, change to the "ocaml-base-08.10" directory:

  $ tar zxvf ocaml-base-08.10.tar.gz
  $ cd ocaml-base-08.10

Build the libraries (byte-code and native):
   
  $ make

Build the documentation: 

  $ make docs

Install the library with findlib:

  $ make install

Uninstall the library with findlib:

  $ make uninstall
